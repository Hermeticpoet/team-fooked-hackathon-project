### Features
We decided as a team that we wanted to build something practical, yet fun. The design
goal for the project was therefore to create a light, colourful web app that could
provide visitors with some good information, while also entertain them a little.

* **Main** landing page consists of a navbar with 3 navigation elements that can collapse 
down into a burger icon when viewed on smaller screens. 

* **Nav** **Elements** are Europe, Asia & Easter Game. The first two will provide some
video and images with basic information about springtime, Easter traditions from various
places around the globe. The third element will be a link to our surprise game.

* **Footer** will simply consist of copyright and the team name.

#### Media
The videos, images and information about the various Easter traditions were all scrapped 
from the web. The game idea was taken from a site that freely shared the code for use.
The images were obtained via commericial free to use & share licenses. The traditions themselves
were gathered from news media sites and government marketing site.
