		<h2>Religious Easter</h2>
		<img src="assets/images/nazarenos.jpg" alt="Nazarenos in Columbia.">
		<p>As the origins of Easter are religious, it’s no surprise that the major celebrations of Easter around the
			globe are based on the Christian faith. But some countries put on a bigger show than others! For example, in
			Columbia and Venezuela you can see the Nazarenos marching in procession over Easter, in impressive flowing
			robes and conical hoods of purple. The cone symbolises rising towards the heavens, and so brings their
			penitence closer to heaven.
			Things are more literal In the Philippines, however, where people literally re-enact the crucifixion at
			Easter! More than 20 people at a time can take part in a single ceremony. The church actually condemns the
			practice, as it is seen as a shadow of earlier pagan rituals. Filipinos also practice Salubong, where they
			re-enact the virgin Mary meeting her son.
			Mexican Christians, meanwhile, put on ‘Passion Plays’ at Easter, showing a dramatic representation of the
			crucifixion. This is also not sanctioned by the church. It does, however, have the backing of the government
			and is designated part of UNESCO’s ‘intangible cultural heritage’.
			The procession can be seen below:

		<h2>Fun Easter!</h2>
		<img src="assets/images/children.jpg" alt="Finish children at Easter.">
		<p>There’s more to Easter than just the traditional religious ceremonies.
			In Finalnd, in one of the most popular family tradition, young children (especially girls) dress up as
			Easter witches, donning colourful old clothes and painting freckles on their faces. Yes in Finalnd, Easter
			is similar to Halloween!
			Finland is not the only country with unusal traditions, however:
			In the Czech Republic and Slovenia, local men and boys will be roaming the streets armed with whips, out to
			whip any woman they come across. The whipping is not meant to be painful (though it may sometimes be) and is
			instead meant to bring health and beauty.
			For a visual demonstration of this traditon and others, check out the video below:</p>
